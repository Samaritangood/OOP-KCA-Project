# OOP-KCA-Project
Gari Dealership System
This repository contains the first phase of the Car Dealership System, a Java project developed for the CSC 113 course during the second semester of 1445. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Java programming concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and array manipulation.

Project Overview
The Car Dealership System is designed to simulate the management of a car dealership. It allows users to add, remove, sell, and edit vehicles within the dealership's inventory. The system also maintains a sales history to track all vehicle transactions.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into multiple Java classes:

Vehicle: An abstract class representing a generic vehicle with common attributes such as make, model, color, year, and price.
Car: A subclass of Vehicle, representing a car with additional attributes such as type.
Motorcycle: Another subclass of Vehicle, representing a motorcycle with specific attributes such as handlebar type.
Dealership: The main class handling dealership operations including managing inventory, sales, and displaying information.
Sale: A class representing a sale transaction, including details of the vehicle sold, buyer's name, contact, and sale date.
Main: The entry point of the program containing the main menu and user interaction functionalities.
Functionality
The system provides the following functionalities:

Displaying all vehicles in the inventory.
Adding new vehicles (cars or motorcycles) to the inventory.
Selling vehicles to customers and maintaining a sales history.
Removing vehicles from the inventory.
Editing vehicle information (make, model, color, year, price, type, handlebar type).
Searching for cars by type.
Finding cars within a specified budget.
